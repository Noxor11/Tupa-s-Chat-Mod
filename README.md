# Tupa's Chat Mod
Hi! This is a chat mod for the Vintage Story game.

## Features

* HTTP / HTTPS link handling
* Handbook link handling
* Moving between chat groups with alt + <chat group number> (eg: alt + 1 while focused on chat)
* Group chat locking with alt + L (while focused on chat) ( **< v1.20** ). It forces the current group chat to stay in place after receiving a notification. It will also keep the chat from opening if the message was received in a different tab.
* Show your current item's handbook page (typing [item] in the chat)

## Vintage Story v1.20
Starting from version 1.20, chats keep focus on the current tab even when a new message arrives.

## Credit
The functionality to find the current item's handbook and showing it was taken from [BillyGalbreath](https://mods.vintagestory.at/list/mod?userid=8180)'s [ChatLinkItem](https://mods.vintagestory.at/chatlinkitem), and slight modifications were added to allow for client side resolution of the current item, as well as client-side hyperlink rendering.
